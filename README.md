Dijkstra's Algorithm
=========================

Python implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a directed weighted graph.

Sample input files are included in the 'input' directory. The starting point for each graph is labeled A, and the ending point is labeled B. The first line of each input file represents the number of vertices in the graph.
